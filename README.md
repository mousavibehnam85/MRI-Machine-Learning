The code reads 2 arrays of MRI each contanng 50 MRI's of healthy and cancerous brains
The images are extracted as single MRI's and training of neurons is carried out
Convolutional Neural Network is used to analyze and test and train
Much more sample is needed to evaluate the real efficiency but it appears to be quite high using the 100 MRI's as of primary tests
